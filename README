When you use a database as a tool for your work, you may have queries you
often use and don't want to write each time.
In this case, as you are a vim user, you may dream of a way to simply create a
menu in vim containing all your queries with a few parameters...
This plugin is for you.

It aims to let you write your queries in sql files as you would normally do it
and then generate a menu for you to access them.
